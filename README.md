# Fortune 500 Company Analysis

This project's goal was to find stastical trends in profit and revenue within the largest companies in America from 1955 to 2013. 

The dataset that I used for this project is derived from http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500_archive/full/2005/ and https://topforeignstocks.com/downloads/
